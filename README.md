# Ecommerce-SQL-Analysis

### Project Overview
This SQL project was designed to demonstrate a practical application of SQL in managing and analyzing an e-commerce database. The project involves creating a database schema with tables for customers, products, and orders. The aim is to showcase how SQL can be used to perform complex queries that provide insights into business operations, such as sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory management.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to:

Build a structured database that reflects real-world e-commerce business requirements.
Use SQL to perform various data manipulations, including inserts, updates, and complex queries involving joins, aggregates, and window functions.
Analyze data to extract actionable insights that could guide business decisions, such as which products are most popular, which customers are most valuable, and how sales trends vary over time.

### Problems Solved
This project addresses several common challenges in database management and data analysis:

Data Organization: Structuring disparate data into a coherent database schema that supports efficient data retrieval.
Data Integrity: Ensuring accuracy and consistency of data through foreign key constraints and appropriate data types.
Business Analytics: Providing comprehensive analyses that help in understanding customer purchasing patterns and product performance.

### Approach
The approach taken to build and utilize this database includes:

Schema Design: Defining tables and relationships that logically organize information about customers, products, and their transactions.
Data Insertion: Populating the database with sample data that simulates real-world business activities.
Query Implementation: Crafting SQL queries that not only retrieve data but also perform analytical computations to gather insights.

### Results
The queries executed in this project deliver various insights:

Sales Analysis: Identified the total sales per product and the most popular products.
Customer Analysis: Calculated average order quantities per customer and ranked customers based on order frequency, highlighting the most engaged customers.
Operational Insights: Detected orders that might have issues, such as missing product information, helping in identifying potential data integrity problems.
